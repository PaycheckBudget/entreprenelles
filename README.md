Project Overview
This repository includes two main HTML files:

index.html – A landing page showcasing different Canva-based website templates for service providers (think: makeup artists, caftan designers, and more).

createlink.html – A WhatsApp link generator. Because copying and pasting phone numbers is so 2010.

Features
Fully Responsive: Works on desktop, tablet, phone, maybe even a fridge if it has a browser.

Free & Easy: Canva hosting is free, plus you can update everything yourself, no dev needed.

WhatsApp Link Creator: Generate custom links that customers can tap to slide into your DMs.

Brandable Templates: Templates for various niches, with a simple drag-and-drop approach on Canva.
